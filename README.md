 5. What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them

 i.  One of the major differences between HTML and JSX is that in JSX, you must return a single parent element, or it won't    compile

 ii. In JSX, it is possible to write JavaScript directly. You can do this by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {...}. Whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.

 iii. To define class names and for attributes in JSX, you don't do it as class or for, since both are reserved keywords in JavaScript. So, to define class names in JSX, you do it as "className" and for attributes for labels you write "HTMLFor".

6. Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?

This is because JSX is not valid JavaScript, browsers can't read it directly; they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler to translate it to React.
